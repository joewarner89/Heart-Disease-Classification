# Heart-Disease-Classification
This project will demonstrate some foundation of machine learning and data science by exploring the problem of heart disease classification.
For our journey to learn data science, we were trilled to learn different techniques. Classification involves deciding whether a sample is part of one class or another (single-class classification). If there are multiple class options, it's referred to as multi-class classification.

We will approach the problem with the following machine learning modelling framework.image.png
