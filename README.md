# Heart-Disease-Classification
This project will demonstrate some foundation of machine learning and data science by exploring the problem of heart disease classification.
For our journey to learn data science, we were trilled to learn different techniques. Classification involves deciding whether a sample is part of one class or another (single-class classification). If there are multiple class options, it's referred to as multi-class classification.

We will approach the problem with the following machine learning modelling framework.image.png

6 Step Machine Learning Modelling Framework More specifically, we'll look at the following topics.

More specifically, we'll look at the following topics.
Exploratory data analysis (EDA) - the process of going through a dataset and finding out more about it.

Model training - create model(s) to learn to predict a target variable based on other variables.
Model evaluation - evaluating a models predictions using problem-specific evaluation metrics.
Model comparison - comparing several different models to find the best one.
Model fine-tuning - once we've found a good model, how can we improve it?
Feature importance - since we're predicting the presence of heart disease, are there some things which are more important for prediction?
Cross-validation - if we do build a good model, can we be sure it will work on unseen data? 7 Reporting what we've found - if we had to present our work, what would we show someone?
